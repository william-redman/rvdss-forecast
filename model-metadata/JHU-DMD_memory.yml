methods_long: "A sliding window is used to construct an temporally local approximation of the Koopman operator. Time-delays and radial basis functions are used for the lifting to function space. An episodic memory mechanism is used to recall previous points in the historical data with similar dynamics. Time-points with matches have forecasts that are a weighted averaged of events that happened previously. All regions, provinces, and national data are used to construct the approximation of the Koopman operator to estimate couplings/correlations. Gaussian noise, of variance is used to sample possible variants of the data to approximate the forecast percentiles."
