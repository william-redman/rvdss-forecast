methods: "Dynamic mode decomposition for time-series."
data_inputs: "Weekly RVDSS from ai4castinghub"
methods_long: "A sliding window is used to construct a temporally local approximation of the Koopman operator. Time-delays and radial basis functions are used for the lifting to function space. All regions, provinces, and national data are used to construct the approximation of the Koopman operator to estimate couplings/correlations. Gaussian noise, of variance is used to sample possible variants of the data to approximate the forecast percentiles."
